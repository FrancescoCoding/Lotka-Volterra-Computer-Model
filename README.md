# Lotka-Volterra-computer-model
A model of the nonlinear system of differential equations in mathematical biology / ecology: the predator-prey relationship of a simple eco-system.

## This model was used to assess:
LO1: Recognise and solve simple computational problems using appropriate mathematical techniques.
LO3: Describe the steps involved in modelling systems and processes.
LO4: Apply analytical and modelling skills to a range of problems relevant to computing and digital media domains.
LO5: Demonstrate skills in problem solving and effective communication in a variety of settings, relevant to future study, research and in the workplace.
