## This model was used to assess:
- LO1: Recognise and solve simple computational problems using appropriate mathematical techniques.
- LO3: Describe the steps involved in modelling systems and processes.
- LO4: Apply analytical and modelling skills to a range of problems relevant to computing and digital media domains.
- LO5: Demonstrate skills in problem solving and effective communication in a variety of settings, relevant to future study, research and in the workplace.
